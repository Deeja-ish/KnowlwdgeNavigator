        <h2>AI & Machine Learning</h2>
        <p class="module-intro">AI and Machine Learning are at the forefront of modern technology. This premium module explains how machines can "learn" and make intelligent decisions from data.</p>

            <h3>1. What is Machine Learning?</h3>
            <p>Machine Learning is a subset of AI where systems are given data and an algorithm to find patterns and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. The more data the system has, the better it gets at its task.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>2. Supervised Learning</h3>
            <p>**Supervised learning** is like learning with a teacher. The system is trained on a set of labeled data (like pictures of cats and dogs that are already identified). It learns to make predictions on new, unlabeled data based on the examples it was given.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>3. Unsupervised Learning</h3>
            <p>In **unsupervised learning**, there is no teacher. The system is given unlabeled data and is asked to find hidden structures or patterns on its own. A common use is **clustering**, where the system groups similar data points together without being told what they are.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>4. Neural Networks</h3>
            <p>**Neural networks** are a more advanced form of machine learning, inspired by the human brain. They are particularly good at pattern recognition tasks, like identifying objects in images or understanding human speech.</p>
