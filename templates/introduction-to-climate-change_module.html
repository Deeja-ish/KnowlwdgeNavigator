        <h2>Introduction to Climate Change</h2>
        <p class="module-intro">Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels.</p>

            <h3>1. The Greenhouse Effect</h3>
            <p>The **greenhouse effect** is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface. Gases in the atmosphere, like carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane, trap heat from the sun. While this is necessary for life, human activity has increased these gases, trapping more heat and causing the planet to warm up.</p>

        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>2. Key Causes of Climate Change</h3>
            <p>The biggest driver is the burning of **fossil fuels** (coal, oil, and gas) for electricity, heat, and transportation. Other major causes include deforestation, which removes trees that absorb CO₂, and industrial processes that release harmful gases.</p>

            <h3>3. Effects of a Warming Planet</h3>
            <p>The consequences of climate change are widespread. They include rising global temperatures, melting glaciers and ice sheets, rising sea levels, more frequent and severe heatwaves, and disruptions to ecosystems and agriculture. These changes can have a huge impact on human society.</p>

            <h3>4. Solutions and Mitigation</h3>
            <p>To combat climate change, we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Solutions include transitioning to **renewable energy** (solar, wind), improving energy efficiency, adopting sustainable practices, and promoting conservation efforts globally.</p>
