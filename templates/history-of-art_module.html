            <h3>1. The Renaissance (c. 1300s - 1600s)</h3>
            <p>The **Renaissance** was a "rebirth" of art and learning, originating in Italy. It was characterized by a focus on humanism, realism, and perspective. Key artists from this period include Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, who created masterpieces like the Mona Lisa and the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel.</p>

            <h3>2. Impressionism (c. 1870s - 1880s)</h3>
            <p>**Impressionism** was a revolutionary movement that broke away from traditional art. Artists like Claude Monet and Edgar Degas focused on capturing the fleeting impression of a scene, often painting outdoors to show the effects of light and color with visible brushstrokes.</p>

        <div class="module-section">
            <h3>3. Post-Impressionism (c. 1880s - 1900s)</h3>
            <p>Following Impressionism, **Post-Impressionists** like Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne used bold colors and emotional expression rather than strict realism. Van Gogh’s "The Starry Night" is a famous example of this movement's expressive style.</p>

            <h3>4. Modern Art (20th Century)</h3>
            <p>Modern art encompasses a wide range of movements, including **Cubism**, led by Pablo Picasso, which broke objects into geometric shapes; and **Surrealism**, which explored the subconscious mind through dreamlike imagery.</p>
